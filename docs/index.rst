About
-----

On many occasions, notifications can be a valuable tool to inform a user about specific events. Sometimes, static notifications or pop-up windows may provide adequate feedback; however, there are some cases where flowing notifications can be more appropriate. ‚ú®

This software allows us to show flowing notifications in the realm of a text or a picture. Both text and pictures (raster and vector) can be customized according to the user's wishes, which offers a wide variety of possibilities for providing flowing feedback. üí¨üñºÔ∏è
